## What is it?

ArkGameServer is a lightweight, fast, scalable, distributed plugin framework with server to create game server easily. Greatly inspired by OGRE and Bigworld.

## Features
- General abstract data system
- Interface-oriented programming (IOP)
- Event-driven and data-driven
- Extensible apps, plugins, and modules
- High concurrency and performance by using actor model (Theron)
- Based on the event-driven and attribute-driven can make business more clear and easy to maintenance
- Based on C++ standard, easy to handle and learn
- Cross platform (Include Windows and Linux)
- Distributed server architecture
- Use Excel as configuration files, easier for users
- With existed Unity3D client for rapid development
